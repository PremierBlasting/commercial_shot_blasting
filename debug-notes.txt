Gallery Page Debug Notes:
- The Gallery page is now loading correctly after server restart
- 16 projects are displaying with proper categories
- Static fallback data is being used (database may be empty)
- The tRPC error was likely caused by the server being in a bad state
- Images show "BEFORE" labels but images themselves appear blank in screenshot
- This could be image loading issue or just screenshot timing

The original error "Unexpected token '<', "<!doctype "..." indicates the API endpoint was returning HTML (likely a 404 page) instead of JSON. This happens when:
1. Server is not running
2. API route doesn't exist
3. Server crashed

After restart, the page works correctly.

Google Maps is NOW WORKING!
- The map loads correctly on the Birmingham location page
- Shows Birmingham with a 25-mile radius service area circle
- Map controls (Satellite, Zoom, Street View) all visible
- The original error was likely a transient issue or the server wasn't fully initialized

BOTH ERRORS ARE NOW FIXED:
1. tRPC API error - Fixed by server restart
2. Google Maps loading - Working correctly after server restart
