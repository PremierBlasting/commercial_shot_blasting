## Replacement Language Used

| Removed | Replaced With |
|---------|---------------|
| SA 2.5 / SA 3 standards | Professional cleanliness |
| ISO 8501 / IMO / NACE standards | Industry requirements |
| Regulatory compliance | Professional practices / Quality service |
| Environmental compliance | Waste management |
| Certification | Assessment (where applicable) |
| Certified for use | Approved for use |
| Quality standards | Quality requirements |
| Cleanliness standards | Cleanliness levels |

| Meeting specifications | Meeting requirements |

## Verification

All 44 affected files have been processed. Remaining mentions of "certification", "regulation", "compliance", or "environmental" are either:
- In non-customer-facing admin pages
- Part of compound words (e.g., "environmental" in unrelated context)
- Acceptable usage (e.g., "high standards" meaning quality level, not formal standards)

## Recommendation

The website now accurately represents the business's current capabilities without making claims about standards, certifications, compliance, or environmental programs that are not currently in place. All service quality messaging has been preserved using appropriate alternative language.
